* Why Clojure ?
  An exercise in /sucker punch/ propaganda ☺
* Shapir Whorf hypothesis
(Yet) Another language ?
 - some languages make better programs
 - some also make better programmers !
* Low barrier to productivity thx to perfect Java interop
 - Can use/create any java object
 - same primitive types (incl. java.lang.String)
Solves the chicken-egg problem (libraries, users base) that have been
keeping us with C for decades despite all the good work in academia.
* A Simple Language
 - Simple :: ≠ easy 
 - Fighting incidental complexity :: There is no pride to have in
      mastering needlessly complex tools (java programmers understand
      this very well when talking about C++ ☺).

* Object Oriented !
 - type
 - identity
 - state
   - attribute names → values
   - mutability
 - (single) dynamic dispatching
 - namespace
Clojure has it *all*, /à la carte/.
* Sane defaults
 - immutability : Value Oriented Programming (transients available but
   the persistent data structures are extremely efficient)
 - dynamic typing (type annotations also available)
 - lexical binding (dynamic binding also available)
 - static dispatching (dynamic dispatching available, single or
   multiple)
 - open structures as maps of interned strings (closed struct available)
* Practical SMP primitives
 - thread local mutations of /vars/
 - queued asynch mutations on /agents/
 - atomics mutations
   - single /atoms/
   - transactions on multiple /refs/
* Very Simple Syntax ☺
"Oh, btw, it's a LISP" (→ angry meme pic ☹)
Not necessarily /easy/ at first but : 
 - syntactic grouping of pairs
 - code is data (list), but most data structures are not lists :
   - [vector]
   - {map}
   - #{set}
 - IDE (e.g. emacs) to the rescue !
   - help writing (electric parenthesis)
   - help reading (rainbow parenthesis)
   - e.g. ≠ i.e. ☺
* Metaprogramming done right
 - David Wheeler :: "All problems in computer science can be solved by
                    another level of indirection".
 - Myself :: "Any boring (part of a) task can and should be automated away"
 - Myself again :: "Programming should be fun !"

Hence you should be able to automate programming !
To make it /easy/, you *need* the /simple/ syntax of code as data structure.

* Conclusion
Perfect Plateform for :
 - Pompous Purists :: you can add your monads with macros !
 - Productivity Pirates™ :: you can reuse all the java libs/frameworks !
 - Painful PHBs :: it's all jars to you, JarJar !

Not all side effects are evil : by learning this language, you'll also
learn concepts form the great minds behind it. You will also get a
better understanding of concepts you already (think you) know
(e.g. OOP, state, time, value, hammocks…).

Learn things and have fun ! (I know you will ☺)
